# 

gai, is a git + AI powered TUI that automatically generates commits, commit
messages, and branches when appropriate.

gai is yet another entry to the **A**rtificial (intelligence) **S**lop
**S**oftware initiative (aka. ASS).

It works by taking a diff of your repo and sending an API request to an LLM AI
provider, where it takes that response and builds out git operations along with
messages for you to review and send out - simplifying the process greatly.

> [!NOTE]
> This is not a complete git replacement. In fact, I recommend heavily relying
> on the git cli and using this primarily when you don't want to create commit
> messages.

# 

gai, is a git + AI powered TUI that uses the intelligence of LLM's to simplify the process of creating entire commits. From staging files or chunks of code, to creating a verbose and well defined commit message. It simplifies the process of version control with the added benefit of a clean commit history.

> [!NOTE]
> This is not a complete git replacement. I still recommend using the git cli or other git based TUI's for complex operations such as resolving merge conflicts.
> While it isn't strictly a planned feature, we currently only support operations such as auto staging, committing, and amending.
